To dive deeper into the distinctions between original films and sequels, we meticulously crafted datasets pairing each original film with its corresponding sequel. This approach ensured a comprehensive comparison. Special attention was paid to address potential bias caused by film sagas, treating each pair of films independently.

                      <p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, spectactors have the feeling of being submerge with sequels after sequels of their favorite movies. But does this trend really shows up in data? We analyzed the release date of more than 80'0000 films from 1888 to 2016</p>

                        Indeed, our analysis on the release years reveals a shifting landscape in the production and distribution of movies. Over time, there is an increase in the overall number of movies hitting the screens. Moreover, the number of movies with sequels has significantly increased over time, reflecting a perhaps growing popularity of franchise movies. These type of movies take an increasingly greater fraction of the overall releases.

Our approach centers on plotting the evolution of earnings from original movies to their sequels. This visual analysis aims to explore the trends and differences in revenue growth or decline between the original films and their subsequent sequels. The analysis uncovers intriguing patterns. Surprisingly, some sequels surpassed their original films, challenging the conventional belief that the first installment often outperforms its successors, and suggesting that certain sequels manage to captivate audiences and generate significant revenue.
                        
The scatter plot reveals a positive correlation between the earnings of original movies and their sequels, indicating that sequels often emulate the financial performance of their predecessors.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        We've seen that movies with sequels seems to gross more profits than regular <i>one-shot</i> films. Could it be due to the timing of their release? The end-of-the-year and early summer are widely recongnized as the best periods for theatrical release and January-February-March <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dump_months">as the worst.</a></br>
                        Let's see if there is any significant difference in the release months between movies with sequels and movies without sequels.</p>

                       

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">As we can see, there is no significant difference between movies with sequels and movie without sequels in their release schedule. On a side note, as expected, the months of October, November and December account for nearly 45% of all films released in a year, and January, February and March only for 6%</p>

Next, we examine the release patterns of movies by their country of origin. We found that most movies in our dataset are from the United States, followed by _____. However, we also observed that movies with sequels are more likely to be from the United States and India than movies without sequels, suggesting that sequels are more prevalent in Hollywood and Bollywood more than in other countries. For the US, this could be due to the higher production budgets, marketing expenditures, and global distribution networks of American studios, which enable them to produce and promote sequels more effectively.

                      <p align="justify">
Moving on to the intrinsic characteristics of movies, we analyzed the genre composition of movies with and without sequels. Our dataset had a large number of subgenres, which made it difficult to compare movies across different genres. Therefore, we simplified our genre analysis by selecting the top 10 most frequent genres in our dataset, and assigning each movie two main genres based on its subgenres. The heatmap allows us to easily visualize the frequency of genre combinations, and we found that movies with sequels are more likely to belong to the action, adventure, comedy, and fantasy genres, while movies without sequels are more likely to belong to the drama, romance, thriller, and horror genres. This suggests that movies  with high entertainment value and spectacle are more prone to getting sequels, whereas original films are more suitable for genres that have high emotional appeal and realism. We also performed a statistical test, which confirms that the genre distribution of movies with and without sequels is significantly different. </p>

Finally, we focused on the character attributes of movies, mainly through the age and gender of the actors. We calculated the median age of the actors for each movie, as well as the ratio of male to female actors for each movie. By looking at these graphs, we found that movies with sequels tend to have younger actors than movies without sequels. [A CHECK] This could indicate that sequels target younger audiences, or that younger actors have more appeal and longevity in the film industry.
