                        <h2>The Lure of Unfinished Stories </h2>
                        
                        <p> Movies are a universal form of entertainment that appeal to audiences worldwide. But what makes a movie successful? Are there particular characteristics of a film that affect its chances of getting a sequel? In this project, we investigate these questions using a large dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2016. We aim to discover the hidden factors that influence the success of movie sequels, and compare them with movies that do not have sequels. </p>
