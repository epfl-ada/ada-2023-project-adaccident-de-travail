# Beyond Originals: A Deep Dive into Sequel Success

## Abstract

Making a sequel in the always changing face of filmmaking is a creative as well as a calculated decision. Our team aims to explore the multiple factors that play a role in the success of movie sequels, questioning whether these continuations achieve a comparable level of popularity to their original or follow a distinct pattern. 
We examine movie’s genre dynamics, looking into how changes either support or contradict a sequel's success. We also analyze the effects of cast changes, asking whether they resonate with audiences or break the established storyline. 
This project aims to reveal layers of complexity beneath the surface of popular entertainment, providing nuanced insights into the complex nature of movie sequels. Our goal is to demystify the decision-making process underlying the sequels and provide a deeper understanding of their dynamics.

## Research questions

To better understand the distinctions between sequels and their original films, our investigation focused on these five main research questions:

1. What is the comparative popularity of sequels in terms of box office grossing compared to their original films? How do the financial performances of sequels correlate with their respective original films?
2. Does the cast significant change between original films and their sequels?
3. Do the genres of movie vary greatly between sequels and original? Do genre changes significantly influence the success of a sequel?
4. Do storylines evolve or remain consistent between original films and their sequels?
5. What is the relative impact of critics' reviews or consumer reviews on the success of a film? (If relevant)
